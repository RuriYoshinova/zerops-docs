# Infrastructure

Zerops provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure built around three key layers: **Projects**, **Services**, and **Containers**. A **Project** is the highest-level entity, serving as a container for all services.

Each project is equipped with essential core functionalities like logging, statistics, HTTP routing with SSL certificates, and IP routing with a built-in firewall. Projects are interconnected via a private network, allowing seamless interaction between services and shared environment variables. Each project comes with a unique IPv6 address by default, with the option to add an IPv4 address for an additional fee.

Within a project, you can deploy an unlimited number of **Services**, which can range from fully managed solutions (handling scaling, repairs, and routing) to partially managed setups. Each service is composed of one or more **Containers**, which utilize Zerops' predefined container images. Depending on the needs of the application, these images can either be fully managed (e.g., databases) or fully customizable (e.g., Ubuntu-based environments). Services can be made publicly accessible via Zerops subdomains or custom domains by configuring DNS records or public IP access.

This structure is designed to provide maximum flexibility and ease of management, allowing you to create isolated environments for different stages of development (e.g., development, staging, production) or consolidate resources to optimize costs. Whether you're working on a simple application or a complex, distributed system, Zerops offers the scalability and control you need to manage your infrastructure efficiently.

## Infrastructure Levels

Zerops has three main levels:

- Projects
- Services
- Containers

## Project

The **project** is the top-level entity, encompassing various **services**. It requires a functioning **core**, which includes: <!-- TODO: max amount of projects -->

- Logger and statistics services
- HTTP routing (with SSL certificates)
- IP routing (with built-in firewall)

The core activates when the first user service is deployed and incurs a fixed monthly fee.

### Key Features

- **Private Network**: All services in a project share a dedicated network and have access to each other's environment variables.
- **IPv6/IPv4**: Each project automatically gets an IPv6 address. An IPv4 address can be added at an extra cost.

:::tip
Create separate projects for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or use one project shared among developers to save costs.

## Services & Containers

### Services

Services are responsible for encapsulating your containers.
A project can host unlimited **services**, which can be:

- **Fully managed**: Includes automatic scaling, routing, and repairs.
- **Partially managed**: Some management aspects are handled manually.

### Containers

Each service consists of one or more **containers**. Containers may vary by function or type, such as in **HA (High Availability) mode**, where a fully managed MariaDB service might have 5 containers (3 for databases, 2 for proxies).

- **Predefined Images**: Containers use Zerops' predefined images, ranging from **fully managed** (e.g., databases) to **customizable** (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Public Accessibility**: Services can be exposed via Zerops subdomains, custom domains, or public ports on IPv6/IPv4 addresses.

**Refer to the technology section for detailed setup instructions.**
